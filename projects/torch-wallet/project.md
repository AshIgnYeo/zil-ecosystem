  Torch Wallet comes with a plethora of revolutionary features like Automated Staking, Instant Unbonding, DEX Token Swaps, Limit Orders and more.

  Automated Staking
  Let Torch's automated staking feature handle your stakes and help you earn maximum profits. Torch makes use of mathematical computations and brings forward the best arrangement for staking and claiming rewards. Be free from the constant market lookouts and enjoy the convenience of Automated Staking without compromising your earnings.

  Reputation Points
  Build up your reputation score by staking with Ignite and unlock exclusive benefits. Reputation points are directly proportional to your time and investment inside the Ignite DAO ecosystem. That is, the more active you are the more value you will receive over time.

  DEX Token Swaps
  Torch offers you the ease of trading currencies inside Zilliqa's ecosystem straight from your wallet. Store and trade your assets and enjoy the hassle free experience. We are here to simplify things for you.

  DEX Limit Orders
  Be liberated from continuously price checking tokens inside the Zilliqa ecosystem. Set the price order of your cryptocurrency and lay back as Torch trades for you. You are able to set limit orders without the excessive hard work while Torch manages your transactions.

  Instant Unstaking
  Torch is the only wallet that allows you to instantly unstake your ZIL without the confines of the normal 14-day unbonding period. This feature will cost you a nominal fee which eventually flows back to the ignite DAO community.
